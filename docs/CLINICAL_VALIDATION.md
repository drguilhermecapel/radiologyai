- ❌ Not validated on real medical datasets
- ❌ Requires FDA/CE regulatory approval
- ❌ Not approved for diagnostic use

## Recommendations for Clinical Deployment

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Model Training**: Train with real medical datasets (>10,000 images per class)
2. **Accuracy Improvement**: Target >85% accuracy for clinical deployment
3. **Clinical Validation**: Prospective validation with radiologist ground truth
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Prepare documentation for FDA/CE approval

### Technical Improvements
1. **Data Augmentation**: Implement advanced augmentation strategies
2. **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold stratified cross-validation
3. **Ensemble Optimization**: Fine-tune attention weights
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement drift detection
